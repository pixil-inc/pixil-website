          The core of this redevelopment strategy is the adoption of a modern, high-performance architecture. This
          approach strategically separates content management from the front-end presentation. Our analysis strongly
          indicates that this is the only path to effectively overcome the performance limitations of competitors and
          ensure future readiness:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong class="text-gray-900">Market Leadership via Performance:</strong> Competitor sites are consistently slow,
          hurting user experience and search rankings. Modern architecture delivers sub-second page load times, immediately
          establishing a competitive advantage in crucial SEO metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-gray-900">Scalability for Growth:</strong> As Specified Roofing's project portfolio, content,
          and services expand, this architecture ensures the website can scale seamlessly without compromising speed or stability,
          a common failure point for traditional systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-gray-900">Unmatched Security:</strong> By decoupling the database and code, the primary attack
          surface is drastically reduced. This offers a level of security and stability essential for a high-value commercial
          enterprise.

          In essence, this proposal is not about a temporary fix; it's about engineering a high-performance,
          future-proof digital platform that transforms the website into a reliable, lead-generating machine and a clear
          industry benchmark.

        Your current website serves as a basic digital brochure but falls short in critical areas of user experience and

          <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-gray-600">
            <li><strong>25+ years of experience</strong> - Strong industry credibility</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive service offerings</strong> - Wide range of roofing systems</li>

            <li><strong>Navigation complexity</strong> - Too many nested dropdown menus</li>

        <strong class="mb-2 block text-lg text-gray-900">Performance & SEO: Why It Matters for Lead Generation</strong>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">
          Website performance isn't just about speed—it's directly connected to your ability to generate qualified
          commercial roofing leads. Google uses Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor. Websites that pass these benchmarks
          rank higher, meaning more property managers find you.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 font-medium text-gray-600">The Three Critical Metrics:</p>
        <ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> How quickly main content loads</li>
          <li><strong>First Input Delay (FID):</strong> How quickly pages respond to interactions</li>
          <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Visual stability as page loads</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          <strong>Our approach:</strong> We utilize modern frameworks engineered to pass all three metrics, whereas traditional
          platforms often struggle with at least one, limiting search visibility.

      <div class="mb-6 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2 text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Our Strategic Approach</div>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
      <p>
        We will build a new website from the ground up to be your most powerful marketing tool. Our strategy aligns user
        needs with business goals, focusing on four key pillars to turn your digital presence into an asset.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="space-y-6">
      <!-- 1. Navigation -->
      <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
        <h4 class="text-md mb-2 font-bold text-gray-800">1. Making the Site Easy to Use (Navigation)</h4>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          We will move away from complex, nested menus. Instead, we will implement a "flat," intuitive structure where
          visitors can find exactly what they need in 3 clicks or less. We will categorize content by <em
            >client need</em
          > (e.g., "I have a leak" vs. "I need a new roof") rather than internal industry terms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 2. Portfolio -->
      <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
        <h4 class="text-md mb-2 font-bold text-gray-800">2. Showcasing Your Expertise (Portfolio)</h4>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          Your history is your strength. We will develop a "Featured Project" showcase on the homepage and a filterable
          portfolio. We will use a case-study format (Challenge → Solution → Result) to prove your capability and build
          immediate trust with prospective clients.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 3. Leads -->
      <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
        <h4 class="text-md mb-2 font-bold text-gray-800">3. Generating More Leads & Quotes</h4>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          We will remove the friction from contacting you. The new site will feature sticky "Request a Quote" buttons
          that follow the user as they scroll, simplified contact forms that are easy to fill out on a phone, and
          "Click-to-Call" buttons for immediate service requests.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 4. Performance -->
      <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
        <h4 class="text-md mb-2 font-bold text-gray-800">4. Speed, Security & Mobile Performance</h4>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          Many contractor websites rely on older platforms that slow down over time and require constant updates to stay
          secure. We will build your site on a <strong>modern, high-performance architecture</strong>. This ensures
          instant loading times (crucial for Google rankings) and bank-grade security, eliminating the maintenance
          headaches common with older websites.
        </p>
      </div>

          </span>
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          To drastically reduce phone tag and paperwork, we have mapped out a <strong>Client Portal</strong> for a future
          phase. This distinct area will allow clients to log in, view project status, download warranties, and make secure
          payments—saving your team hours of administrative work.

        The current Specified Roofing website has strong foundational content but lacks the modern UX, visual appeal,
        and conversion optimization necessary to compete in today's digital landscape. By implementing the recommended
        sitemap, page strategies, and design improvements, Specified Roofing will make it easier for clients to find
        information and request quotes, showcase 25+ years of expertise through compelling project stories, build trust
        through prominent social proof, educate clients through valuable resources, convert more visitors into leads
        through optimized conversion paths, and position itself as the clear choice for commercial roofing in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        This redesign will transform the website from an informational brochure into a powerful business development
        tool that works 24/7 to generate quality leads and reinforce Specified Roofing's position as Canada's trusted
        commercial roofing partner.
